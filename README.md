# onionhook-cosmic-cheat
An injectable cheat for the CosmicClient.

Includes reach and aim-assist, but it is easy to add other features.

# Information
I created this project about a year ago just as a side project for learning some more about reversing. I don't have any use for it, and never did really, so I've put it on here just in-case someone does. I hit a wall when trying to make the mappings automatic, so I made my [java-class-file-parser](https://github.com/quantiom/java-class-file-parser) library and never returned to polish up this one.
